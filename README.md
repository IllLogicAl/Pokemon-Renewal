# Pokemon-Renewal

Welcome to Pokemon Renewal! We will be attempting to make a fan-made Pokemon game utilizing RPG Maker XP and Pokemon Essentials. This game will feature the same 721 Pokemon you know and love in an all new region with an intriguing storyline and lots of extra content to enhance your experience. We have lots of room to work with, so let's do our best!

<b>FAQ:</b>
<b>What is Pokemon Renewal?</b>
Pokemon Renewal is a fan-made game led by Nathan Geer that uses Pokemon Essentials. It does not currently feature any new Pokemon, but will introduce a new region and intriguing storyline along with extra gameplay content.

<b>Wait a minute…who? Does he have any experience making games?</b>
 
Good point, I don't have any game-making experience, though I did try to organize Pokemon Crimson.

<b>…That didn't work, did it? So what's different this time?</b>
Good point again, there are a few differences here. The big one is Pokemon Essentials, which utilizes RPG Maker XP and has been used in many other well-known fan games. Another is that this game is not of Grove City College, but an entirely new region. As such, we are not limited by a campus location or knowledge of said college and can include many more people. This leads to another important note: I'm not alone this time. I already have people in charge of design/tiles (Elisabeth), scripting/features (Stephen), and even music (Martin).

<b>What is Pokemon Essentials?</b>
Essentials is a pack of information given to RPG Maker XP containing everything needed to make a Pokemon game. The resulting game will not be a rom or rom hack, meaning you do not need an emulator to play it.
RPG Maker XP is just as it sounds. It is the premier RPG maker for PC. Pokemon Essentials makes it SUPER easy to make a Pokemon game out of it. Any further questions can be answered by going to their wiki, http://pokemonessentials.wikia.com/....

<b>Okay, sounds like you've got something here…what can I do?</b>
 That's the part I've been working towards most. Short answer, whatever you can provide! If you want a little more authority over some aspect of the game, just let me know and we'll work it out. Otherwise, this Facebook group will be used to get your opinions of various game aspects. My current goal is to constantly have a topic of discussion available on this page so you can input your thoughts on it. These topics may range from "what should the starters be?" to "what should this town's theme be?" to "what changes should be made to the HP bar?". Whatever we're working on at any given time!

<b>MAP + STORY:</b>

<b>So you mentioned a new map…well?</b>
Here is the most recent map update:

(Please let me know if link doesn’t work)
After some discussion,  we have decided to base the region off of South America! It’s nice to have familiar regions to explore that have been Pokemon-ified. This is still under construction and all future map updates  will be done in Paint in a style that could be put into the game. THIS ISN’T FINAL. I’d like to have more map discussion in the future.

<b>Beginning?</b>
As of now, I’d like to begin in the area that would be Quito, in the upper-left part of the continent. The Elite 4 might be cool to be the Galapagos. Otherwise, the other towns and such are various cities/landmarks actually on the continent.

<b>I don't like *insert map thing*. Can we change that?</b>
Well, we'll have a general map discussion to start off, but otherwise please do not bring it up randomly. Instead, wait for the appropriate discussion time.

<b>Okay…so what's the story you've got? I don't want to work on something with a lame story…</b>
Edit: Updated with “short” summary! 
Your character and your rivals/friends set out on a Pokemon adventure! After learning about the origins of the region in the first gym, a mysterious fellow impressed by your skills wants to sit down and talk a bit more. After accepting his invitation to explore the mysterious lake, events start happening quickly. Three mysterious cyborg beings appear in a flash of light, citing Dialga as the one responsible for their travel. Soon after, Giratina emerges from the Distortion World onto this island. Not only this, but Mew, a teenager and a younger boy are thrown out from the Distortion World. Mew quickly disappears as the younger boy claims himself to be Arceus, the legendary Pokemon. The ground starts shaking and all parties flee the scene immediately. Having witnessed these strange events, the main character continues on his journey only to find that the Caelum Knights, a group of bad guys from long ago who pillaged and terrorized the region, have returned. Additionally, one of the Professor’s Pokemon has been stolen. What in tarnation is going on? How are all of these events connected? What will you do when it is your turn to save the past, present, and future?

<b>GENERAL:</b>

<b>Okay, so what's old and new in this game?</b>
All 721 Pokemon. No new ones as of now. Mega evolutions are planned but difficult to implement from what I gather. Otherwise, it's the same old Pokemon game you know and love. More emphasis will be placed on story and special features, but nothing else big as of now.

<b>Rival? Starters?</b>
These go hand-in-hand, so here we go. I want 4 rivals, like in X+Y, but I want to do it right. Starters will be the starters available from all 6 gens. The current plan is that starters from each gen will be given to someone, with each gen being super effective against the gen coming after it. For example: you decide to pick up a Cyndaquil as your starter. One rival will pick the super effective starter against it, in this case Squirtle because it comes from the generation before Cyndaquil. Another will pick Treecko, the starter weak to yours in the generation after. In the other 3 generations, one will pick a Water type (in this case, Piplup) and one will pick a Fire type (in this case, Tepig). This does leave the last generation and the Grass starter…this one (in this case, Chespin) goes to the hidden "rival", the opposite gendered MC sprite of yours that plays a role in the story I haven't fully fleshed out yet.

<b>Hey, this is really cool! I wanna be in the game!</b>
Before you ask, no, you will probably not be even a minor character in the game. However, I do believe if you want to be in the game, we can arrange for that in some way shape or form. We'll talk about that much later!

<b>Can my friends join too?</b>
 I don't see why not! Let me know you're inviting somebody so I can at least figure out why people are in the group helping out, and I will approve them immediately.

<b>What are the gym leaders? Ooh, I have a great idea for a gym, and there can be a Magikarp trainer in there hahah, and a couple with an Onix and Cloyster LOL, and...</b>
I’m going to stop you there. PLEASE do not go off on tangents like this too much and try to keep discussion more focused. Anyways...gym leaders are undecided, your idea is probably cool please wait until we get to that discussion point, and no we won’t be putting meme trainers in serious areas just for lulz. Okay?

<b>When is this going to be finished? Any timetables or deadlines for parts of the game?</b>
Short answer, no. Nothing is set in stone yet, and we’ve barely begun at all, so it seems unreasonable right now to be setting deadlines. I want our foundation to be strong (tiles, familiarity with the programs, etc.) before we really start creating the game too.
NOTE: We are going to start moving towards the first gym. It would be nice to have a nice foundation of tiles design, but we also have to get moving at some point. Having a game with a consistent design through the first gym is enough for a demo version, which will raise interest and awareness in the project.

<b>I have a question/suggestion for a daily question...</b>
Feel free to message me at any time with any questions/concerns/suggestions you may have, even if they aren’t currently on topic. I’m more than willing to talk with all of you about anything relating to the project!

Remember, this is a living document! Questions and answers can and will be added when necessary.
